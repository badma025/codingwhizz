Web development deals with the design and layout of a website, while game development focuses on creating the game itself. It would be unfair to say that game development is completely different from website development, but there are many important differences between the two types of developers. The game development process is the art of conceptualizing, designing, coding, and ultimately releasing a video game. Today's website develops interactions and artificial intelligence, but has not yet reached the depth of function recommended in video games.

Therefore, the principle of web development is related to game development. But the game has gone a step further and improved it as the complexity of things demands it. As a result, game developers are too well-versed in best practices, leaving web developers behind. This is another element of the gap between games and the Internet.

Video game development requires the use of various components in the development process. This includes aspects of physics, digital models, basic logic, environments and more. included. When it comes to website development, you don't have to worry. People who enter the field of web development are usually involved in 3D rendering, creative direction, web programming, engine development, etc. specialty.

Web development can be used for any website, but game development is mainly used for video games. "So what should I choose?" In short, you have to choose what interests you. If you don't have passion, you should have a choice. In general, the development of the game is the leading. Both are high-paying jobs, but web development costs a little more and is easy to start.

So you are interested in programming and want to make it a profession. We've explored and compared the two paths to see which is right for you, game development or web development. To help you make an informed decision, I've listed the pros and cons of both options here. The idea of ​​being a game developer is sexy, serious and desirable. But it's difficult to break into this industry. On the other hand, there is web development that tickles programming and still pays for itself. Let's analyze whether game development is better than web development.

Web development deals more with coding while game development deals more with scripting. The two disciplines have completely different approaches to work and life. Most web developers have fairly stable jobs with fixed hours and decent tasks. On the other hand, many game developers not only work long hours, but also face insecurity and low pay for full-time jobs because of their skills. Web developers can also speak on an equal footing with game developers when it comes to programming paradigms. Which paradigm is important varies from industry to industry, but the current trends in web and gaming are different. Programming best practices differ between the two disciplines, but it makes sense to solve different problems. Ultimately, web developers and game developers are in two different worlds.

Another difference in the game is the way the elements are structured. In "normal" development, including web development, most things are code-based. To run the project, you must call `main()` or equivalent. Not so in game development. Everything here relies on a script that tells the application how to start, its dependencies, etc. You decide. It is not a fair assumption to assume that web developers can do the work of game developers and vice versa. Each type of development has its own processes, disciplines, procedures and collaboration requirements, etc. exists, making the work similar, but certainly not interchangeable.
